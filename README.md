# LLM in Plain English

> My study notes on LLM and its applications

When you first start learning about LLM, you'll be overwhelmed by the amount of information available.

So where should you start?
What's the learning path?

This GitHub repo stores all the notes on my study of LLM and its applications. The goal is to guide you into the realm of LLM in the least amount of time, so you can begin your own exploration and development with confidence.

We're going to cover the following topics:

- [LLM in Python](./notes/llm_in_python.md): virtual environment, ollama, Google Colab, etc
- [Basic Conecpts](./notes/basic_concepts.md): Chat Model, Chat Completion, Chain, Assistant, Agent, Tool and Function
- [Prompt Engineering](./notes/prompt_engineering.md): Few-Shot, Zero-Shot, CoT, RAG, ReAct
- [Low-code Tools](./notes/low_code_tools.md): Flowise, LangFlow, n8n
- [LangChain Expression Language](./notes/langchain_expression_language.md): The language used to build LLM applications
- [Project H.E.R](./notes/project_her.md): A project to emulate the AI in the movie "Her"

**Coming Soon:**

- Large Language Models: OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, and Open source LLMs
- Developer Tools: HuggingFace, Colab, Ollama, LM Studio, Flowsie, n8n, etc
- Agents: LangGraph, AutoGen, AutoGPT, etc
